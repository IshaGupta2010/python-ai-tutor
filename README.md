# AI Python Tutor

Welcome to the AI Python Tutor! This interactive tutor uses LangChain and Ollama's Mistral model to help you learn Python through examples and coding challenges. It runs on your local machine and supports memory retention and feedback.

## 📚 Features

- **Interactive Python Tutor**: Chat with the tutor and get Python concepts explained.
- **Memory Retention**: Remembers previously learned concepts.
- **Coding Challenges**: Solve small coding challenges and receive feedback.
- **Offline-Ready**: No internet required once set up.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**: The core language for running the tutor.
- **LangChain**: Used for natural language processing and managing the flow of interactions.
- **Streamlit**: To build the web interface.
- **Ollama**: Running Mistral LLM locally to power the AI tutor.
- **SQLite**: For storing memory and learned concepts.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**: Make sure Python is installed. You can check by running:
  ```bash
  python --version
Ollama: Download and install Ollama. This will run Mistral locally.

Download Ollama

Install Dependencies
Clone the repository and install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/python-ai-tutor.git
cd python-ai-tutor
pip install -r requirements.txt
🧑‍💻 Running the App Locally
Run Ollama: Start the Ollama Mistral model. Open a terminal and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
ollama run mistral
This ensures that Ollama is running locally.

Start the Streamlit app: In the same terminal window (or a new terminal window in the project folder), run:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run main.py
Interact with the AI Tutor: Once the Streamlit app starts, open your browser and go to:

bash
Copy
Edit
http://localhost:8501
You should see the AI tutor interface, where you can ask Python-related questions, solve coding challenges, and get feedback!
